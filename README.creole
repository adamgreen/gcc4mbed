==Quick Start
These are the quick steps to get gcc4mbed installed on your computer:
* Download the gcc4mbed compressed archive from [[https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed/zipball/master]]
* Decompress and extract the contents of this archive to the location where you want gcc4mbed and the GNU Tools for ARM
  Embedded Processors to be installed.
* Run the install script appropriate for your platform:
** Windows: win_install.cmd
** OS X: mac_install
** Linux: linux_install
* You can then run the BuildShell script which will be created during the install to properly configure the PATH
  environment variable to run the GNU tools just installed within the gcc4mbed directory.  You may want to edit this
  script to further customize your development environment.

===Important Notes:
* Builds can fail on **Windows** with weird errors when using a version of make other than the version of GNU make found
  in external/win32. You may need to make sure that Cygwin/MingW versions of the shell or make don't interfere as the
  gcc4mbed scripts/makefiles are built to work on stock Windows and not require such Posix compatibility environments.
* The **Linux** install only installs 32-bit Intel binaries.  If you are running a 64-bit version of Intel Linux then you
  will need to install the 32-bit support libraries.  This problem typically shows up as a file not found error when you
  attempt to run tools such as arm-none-eabi-g++.  On Ubuntu 12.04, the necessary libraries can be installed by running
  {{{sudo apt-get install ia32-libs}}}.  Ubuntu >=13.10 should use
  {{{sudo apt-get install -y lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0}}} instead.
* The **OS X** install only supports 64-bit Intel machines.  The installers for the other platforms only install 32-bit
  Intel binaries.
* **OS X** Mountain Lion and newer will fail to execute mac_install by simply clicking on it.  Instead right click on
  mac_install in the Finder, select the Open option, and then click the Open button in the resulting security warning
  dialog.
* Files will fail to install to a FAT based file system.  Extract to a more appropriate file system (ie. NTFS on
  Windows) first and then copy to a FAT drive after installation.
* If the installation should fail, please refer to win_install.log, linux_install.log, or mac_install.log.  It will
  contain the details of the installation process and any errors that were encountered.
* If you don't need floating point support from scanf() and printf() routines in your program then you can reduce your
  binary size by setting NO_FLOAT_SCANF and NO_FLOAT_PRINTF make variables to 1.  See samples/HelloWorld/makefile for an
  example.

==Thanks
The author wants to thank Arthur Wolf for the [[http://developer.mbed.org/forum/mbed/topic/2336/|posting]] he made back in May on 2011 which kicked off this whole gcc4mbed project and for all of the testing and feedback he has given since.

Thanks to Felyza Wishbringer for writing the first Windows install script which provided the inspiration for the Windows, Mac, and Linux scripts that are now included in the gcc4mbed project.

Thanks for all of the others who have provided valuable feedback since this project was first released.  Much of that feedback can be found in this [[http://developer.mbed.org/forum/mbed/topic/2701/|mbed forum thread]]

==Have fun!!

==Adding New Devices to GCC4MBED
The initial version of GCC4MBED which took advantage of the open source mbed SDK only supported the LPC1768, LPC11U24,
and KL25Z platforms.  It is however possible to add support for any of the other devices already supported by the
mbed SDK for the TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM set of tools.  This page describes the steps necessary to enable a new device in the
GCC4MBED makefiles.

==github Pull Requests
If you add support to GCC4MBED and you want to see it included in future GCC4MBED updates, then please issue a pull
request on github.  During future updates I will make sure that things still build for these platforms but the resulting
binaries will not be tested since I don't have the necessary hardware.

==Example Walkthrough
I will now show adding LPC1347 device support to walk you through the process to add support for new devices.

First let's go into the build/ subdirectory of the GCC4MBED project and copy LPC1768-device.mk to LPC1347-device.mk
since it is the closest platform already supported (same vendor and same Cortex-M3 family).  I recommend using uppercase
characters for the LPC1347 prefix as it is used by some of the makefiles to determine all of the supported platforms and
you want it to match the case of the symbols actually defined for this device.

To get an idea of what preprocessor defines should be set for building code for this platform, I kick off a build of the
mbed SDK using their Python based build system in verbose mode so that I can look at the command line params they pass
into GCC when performing the build.  For example, I ran the following command:
{{{
workspace_tools/build.py -m LPC1347 -t GCC_ARM -v
}}}

I grabbed one of the GCC command lines from the console output and pulled out the defines onto their own line so that I
could look at them more closely:

{{{

}}}

Based on this output, I modified the newly created LPC1347-device.mk like so:

{{{

< MBED_TARGET        := NXP_LPC17XX

}}}

I then modified the samples/HelloWorld/makefile so that it DEVICES variable now contained LPC1347 as well:

{{{
-DEVICES         := LPC1768 LPC11U24 KL25Z
+DEVICES         := LPC1768 LPC11U24 KL25Z LPC1347
}}}

Running {{{make}}} in the HelloWorld directory will build for all 4 supported platforms.  Running {{{make LPC1347}}}
will just build for the LPC1347 target.
